.. note::

   You'll probably want to use the `umode` and `chanmode` functions instead of this function.

Example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    client.mode("omnidan", "+p", event.network); // set mode on specific user
    client.mode(client.me, "+p", event.network); // set mode on current client
    client.mode("#caffeinery", "+v omnidan", event.network); // voice a user in a specific channel
    client.mode(event.channel, "+v omnidan", event.network); // voice a user in the current channel


.. coffeafunction:: umode(flags, network, fn)

              :param string flags: Flags of the mode change.
              :param string network: The network to execute the command on.
              :param function fn: The callback function to be called when the call has been finished.

Sets modes on the current client.

Example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    client.umode("+p", event.network); // set mode on current client


.. coffeafunction:: chanmode(channel, mode, target, network, fn)

              :param string channel: Channel to change modes on.
              :param string mode: Consists of +/- and a mode character, e.g. `+v`, `-o`
              :param array/object/string target: Target for the mode change, can be (a) user(s) or channel(s).
              :param string network: The network to execute the command on.
              :param function fn: The callback function to be called when the call has been finished.

Sets modes on a channel.

.. note::

   There are helper functions that work like `client.chanmode`, but without having to specify the `mode`: voice, devoice, op, deop, hop, dehop

Example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    client.chanmode("#caffeinery", "+v", "omnidan", event.network); // voice a user in a specific channel
    client.chanmode(event.channel, "+v", "omnidan", event.network); // voice a user in the current channel
    client.chanmode(event.channel, "+v", ["omnidan", "np_coffea"], event.network); // voice multiple users in the current channel

    // or using helper functions...
    client.voice("#caffeinery", "omnidan", event.network); // voice a user in a specific channel
    client.voice(event.channel, "+v", "omnidan", event.network); // voice a user in the current channel
    client.voice(event.channel, "+v", ["omnidan", "np_coffea"], event.network); // voice multiple users in the current channel
