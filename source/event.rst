Event API
========


Events are applied using the following example (basically standard NodeJS EventEmitter syntax):

.. code-block:: javascript

		client.on('EVENT', // `EVENT` being any of the events listed in the documentation.
		  function(event) { // callback function, called when event is fired
		    console.log('Something happened!');
		  });
